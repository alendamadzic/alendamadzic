A few years ago, I watched a startup burn through £2 million building the wrong product. Not because the team was incompetent. Not because the market didn't exist. But because they skipped straight from idea to execution without ever stopping to validate they were solving a real problem.

Meanwhile, at a different company, I watched enterprise teams spend six months in "discovery" before writing a single line of code. By the time they shipped, the market had moved on.

Both teams would have benefited from phase-gate methodology. But neither would admit it because somewhere along the way, "phase-gate" became a dirty word.

## The Reputation Problem

Let's be honest about why people hate phase-gates. The stereotype is real: bloated stage-gate processes with 47 approval forms, quarterly review boards that meet regardless of project readiness, and decks that exist purely to satisfy executives who haven't looked at the product since the kickoff meeting.

In these systems, gates aren't quality checks. They're theatre. Teams game them, fill out templates with whatever gets sign-off, and then do what they were going to do anyway. The methodology becomes bureaucracy for bureaucracy's sake.

But here's the thing: that's not phase-gate methodology. That's just bad process wrapped in phase-gate clothing.

## What Phase-Gates Actually Do

Strip away the enterprise cruft and phase-gate methodology is embarrassingly simple: **Don't start the next thing until you've validated the current thing.**

That's it. That's the entire methodology.

Before you build, prove you understand the problem. Before you ship, prove the solution actually works. Before you scale, prove people will pay for it. It's just structured common sense.

The startup that burned £2 million? They failed at gate one. They never proved anyone actually wanted what they were building. They just assumed, then executed beautifully on the wrong thing.

The enterprise team that took six months? They had too many gates with too little substance. They were measuring "did we do the activities" instead of "did we learn anything."

Phase-gates aren't the problem. Bad software that makes phase-gates painful is the problem.

## The Tooling Gap

Here's where it gets interesting. Most project management tools treat phase-gates as an afterthought. They're fundamentally task managers with some workflow bolted on. You want gates? Sure, make a custom field called "Status" and remember to update it manually. Good luck.

Or you get enterprise portfolio management systems that cost £100k per year and require three months of consultant time to configure. They have all the gates you could dream of, plus 400 features you'll never use, plus a UI that makes everyone want to quit.

The gap is this: phase-gate methodology is actually brilliant for most teams, but the software options are either inadequate or overwhelming. So teams throw out the methodology instead of finding better tools.

It's like watching everyone switch to notepad because Word became bloated. The answer isn't to abandon word processing. It's to build better word processors.

## What Modern Phase-Gates Look Like

Good phase-gate software should be opinionated and fast. You shouldn't spend a week configuring fields. You should pick a template, assemble your team, and start working.

The gates should be meaningful questions, not checkbox theatre:

- Discovery: Do we understand the problem well enough to propose a solution?
- Design: Have we validated this solution with actual users?
- Build: Does this meet our quality standards?
- Launch: Are we ready to support this in production?

Each gate is a decision point. Green means keep going. Red means stop and fix something. It's not about paperwork, it's about not being stupid.

And crucially, the software should surface what matters. Show me what's blocked. Show me what's overdue. Show me where teams are waiting on approvals. Don't make me hunt through 47 dashboards to figure out why nothing's shipping.

## Why Startups Need This Too

I can already hear the objection: "Phase-gates are for big companies with slow-moving bureaucracies. Startups need to move fast."

Sure. Move fast. Move fast off a cliff if that's your preference.

Every failed startup I've seen failed because they moved fast in the wrong direction. They skipped validation. They built features no one asked for. They scaled before finding product-market fit. They did all the things that a basic phase-gate would have caught.

You know what's slow? Pivoting after 18 months because you never validated your assumptions. You know what's fast? Spending two weeks in discovery, realising the idea is rubbish, and killing it before you waste time building.

Phase-gates aren't about moving slowly. They're about not doing stupid things. Startups desperately need this. They just need it implemented in software that doesn't make them want to die.

## The Path Forward

Phase-gate methodology isn't dead. It's been waiting for software that doesn't suck.

The methodology itself is sound. Structure prevents chaos. Gates prevent waste. Quality checks prevent shipping garbage. These are good things.

What we need are tools that make phase-gates feel natural instead of bureaucratic. Tools that get out of your way. Tools that are opinionated about workflow but flexible about details. Tools that help you ship better products faster, not tools that exist to generate reports for executives.

The alternative is what we have now: startups careening from idea to idea with no structure, enterprises drowning in process, and everyone pretending that "being agile" means "not planning anything."

There's a better way. It's called phase-gate methodology. It just needed better software.
